# Multiplication-N-Tiles

This is a simple game to assist in the development of efficeint multiplication strategies. 

It represents multiplication facts using groups of dots. For example 4 x 5 can be 4 groups of 5 dots or 5 groups of 4 dots. This concrete representation can
provide a basis on with which the user can develop their own efficient strategies.


## Example
Consider 4 x 5. This can be represented as 4 groups of 5. We will start with 1 group of 5 and build up to 4 groups with our strategy. 

![Usage Example 1](./examples/1.png?raw=true "Example 1")

We can get to 4 groups by doubling, and then doubling again.

![Usage Example 2](./examples/2.png?raw=true "Example 2")

![Usage Example 3](./examples/3.png?raw=true "Example 3")

![Usage Example 4](./examples/4.png?raw=true "Example 4")

And we are done!
